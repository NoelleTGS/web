# Translations
We are still yet to implement multi language support, but there is a (crowdin)[https://crowdin.com/project/wysi] 
project that handles all the "words" to translate, so if you wish to contribute to any language
feel free to do so, if your language is not on the list, DM me and i'll add it

# wysi

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.25. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
